Description
===========

This library is an [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) proxy written in Lua. TLS parsing part is rewritten from [dlundquist/sniproxy](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy)

Note that nginx [stream module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) and [ngx_stream_lua_module](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module) is required.

Tested on Openresty >= 1.9.15.1.

Experimental.

Synopsis
========


```
stream {
    init_by_lua_block {
        local sni = require("resty.sniproxy")
        sni.rules = { 
            {"www.google.com", "www.google.com", 443},
            {"www.facebook.com", "9.8.7.6", 443},
            {"api.twitter.com", "1.2.3.4"},
            {".+.twitter.com", nil, 443},
            {".", "unix:/var/run/nginx-default.sock"}
        }   
    }

    # for OpenResty >= 1.13.6.1, native Nginx proxying
    lua_add_variable $sniproxy_upstream;
    lua_add_variable $sniproxy_port;
    server {
            error_log /var/log/nginx/sniproxy-error.log error;
            listen 443;

            resolver 8.8.8.8;

            prepread_by_lua_block {
                    local sni = require("resty.sniproxy")
                    local sp = sni:new()
                    sp:preread_by()
            }
            proxy_pass $sniproxy_upstream:$sniproxy_port;
    }

    # for OpenResty < 1.13.6.1, Lua land proxying
    server {
            error_log /var/log/nginx/sniproxy-error.log error;
            listen 443;

            resolver 8.8.8.8;

            content_by_lua_block {
                    local sni = require("resty.sniproxy")
                    local sp = sni:new()
                    sp:content_by()
            }
    }
}
```

A Lua array table `sni_rules` should be defined in the `init_worker_by_lua_block` directive.

The first value can be either whole host name or regular expression. Use `.` for a default host name. If no entry is matched, connection will be closed.

The second and third values are target host name and port. A host can be DNS name, IP address or UNIX domain socket path. If host is not defined or set to `nil`, **server_name** in SNI will be used. If the port is not defined or set to `nil` , **443** will be used.

Rules are applied with the priority as its occurrence sequence in the table. In the example above, **api.twitter.com** will match the third rule **api.twitter.com** rather than the fourth **.+.twitter.com**.

If the protocol version is less than TLSv1 (eg. SSLv3, SSLv2), connection will be closed, since SNI extension is not supported in these versions.
